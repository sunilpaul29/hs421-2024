    "\n",
    "In some instances, it becomes necessary to incorporate qualitative variables as explanatory factors in regression analysis. In such scenarios, proxy variables are constructed to represent these qualitative aspects. Dummy variables serve this purpose effectively. A dummy variable is an artificial construct that assumes a value of 1 when the qualitative attribute it represents is present, and 0 otherwise. For instance, 1 might denote female gender while 0 signifies male gender, or 1 could represent college graduation while 0 denotes otherwise. Dummy variables are integrated into regression models alongside other explanatory variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example:__ Suppose we have data on income of females and males. Assume that income is dependent on the gender of the individual, then we can model this relation as follows: $$Y=\\alpha _{f}D_{f}+\\alpha _{m}D_{m}+\\varepsilon,$$ where $Y$ is the income, $D_{f}$ is a dummy variable taking the value one whenever the observation in question is a female and zero otherwise. $D_{m}$ is also defined likewise for the males."

    "The equation in the example given above does not contain an intercept. Note that $D_{f}+D_{m}=1.$ __dummy variable trap__. Hence if we have a qualitative variable with '$m$' categories we can use only '$m-1$' dummy variables to represent them in a regression with intercept. Dropping $D_{m}$ we may rewrite the example given above as $$Y=\\alpha _{0}+\\alpha _{f}D_{f}+\\varepsilon.$$ The category for which no dummy variable is assigned is known as the base, benchmark, control, comparison, reference, or omitted category. And all comparisons are made in relation to the benchmark category."
